# About me
My name is **Alessandro Di Ronza** and I'm a small iOS and Android developer, everyday I try to improve my skills by learning something new. When I first discovered Dart I was amazed by the great potential of this language, so I started studying it through an online course.

# The course I followed
The course's name is **"Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2023 Edition]"** and it's run by an amazing teacher called **Maximilian Schwarzmüller** (I encourage to check his socials), he is part of Academind, an organization with a variety of other courses which has its own repositories on GitHub as well. Every file uploaded in the "course-apps" section was built thanks to this course so all the credits go to them for helping me learning the language.

# My future projects
I aim to upload my own apps in the future on a separate section. I'm planning to make copies of popular apps as well as my own ideas to show what I can do with this amazing tool.
